# ISM6251-Repo-Data-Science-Programming-

I've covered a range of basic and advanced machine learning and deep learning subjects in the several notebooks, which address various facets of machine learning. starting with the fundamentals of Python and moving on to a variety of machine learning strategies like decision trees and ensemble methods. After that, I researched text mining, neural networks, and deep learning concepts like autoencoders and convolutional neural networks. Recurrent neural networks were also discussed because they function well with sequential data. The course came to an end with a final lecture that probably summarized the key takeaways from each subject covered. I feel as though I have gained a strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning, which will enable me to take on a variety of real-world problems.
